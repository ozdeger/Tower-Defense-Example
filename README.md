# Tower-Defense-Example

     Most Settings Can be configured from the 'Level Config' scriptable object in Resources and MANAGERS/GameManager in the scene.
 
     I have developed the game as a pluggable behaviour system which is easy to expand upon,
     because most tower defense games have roguelite elements and tower upgrading these days.
     While developing this project i had 5 days which 3 of them was work days so i couldn't have much time to spare.
     Didn't have time to implement a saving system and dividing to project to assembly definitions yet i do have work experience on those cases as well.

     Scenes are saved with an editor script which can be accesed from Tools/Create Scene Pool

     High Score save data can be deleted from Tools/Delete Save Datas.

     More configurations can be found in the following scriptable objects:
     -> Resources/ScriptableObjects/Behaviours
     -> Resources/ScriptableObjects/ScenePools
     -> Resources/ScriptableObjects/Pools
